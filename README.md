# Programming

### ESPHome Dashboard Import "NEW"

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PricelessToolkit/ESPClicker/main/img/dot.jpg" width="247" height="399" />

AND PUT "espclicker-XXXXXX" SUFFIX

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PricelessToolkit/ESPClicker/main/img/adopt.jpg" width="684" height="177" />

WITHOUT THIS IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DO OTA UPDATE, BECAUSE ESPhome WILL TRY TO RESOLVE  ADDRESS ON "espclicker.local".


### UPLOAD VIA WIFI Captive Portal
The captive portal component in ESPHome is a fallback mechanism for when connecting to the configured WiFi fails. 
After 1 minute of unsuccessful WiFi connection attempts, the ESP will start a WiFi hotspot with the credentials

```
SSID "ESPClicker-XXXXXX Fallback Hotspot"
Password "password"
```
When you connect to the fallback network, the web interface should open automatically (see also login to network notifications). 
If that does not work, you can also navigate to http://192.168.4.1/ manually in your browser. In this web interface, 
you can manually override the WiFi settings of the device. Additionally, you can upload a new firmware file to your node without having to use a USB cable for uploads.


### UPLOAD VIA USB ###

1. Open your ESPHome dashboard.
2. Create new ESPhome device and paste your config then save it
3. Find your device card click on menu (TREE DOTS)
